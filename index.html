        <p><strong>PARIS, July 5 (Reuters)</strong> - Parisians rushed for a dip in the Seine on Saturday as authorities 
        opened the river to public swimming for the first time since 1923 after an extensive clean-up 
        operation spurred on by it being used last year as a venue in the Paris Olympics.
        </p>
        <p>
        Three sites along the banks of the Seine in the city will be able to welcome over 1,000 swimmers 
        daily until August 31, local officials said, to the delight of the Parisians and visitors who were 
        among the first to take the plunge.

        "Really nice, I'm impressed, surprised," said 24-year-old Victoria Cnop, a Brazilian who lives in Paris. 
        "I never imagined being in the water close to the Eiffel Tower."

        "The water is clean, it's warm, it's clear. There is a bit of algae, but that's normal," said 51-year-old Karine. 
        "Come here everybody, it's great!."

        The reopening of the Seine for public swimming follows efforts by authorities to improve its

        Investments included connecting tens of thousands of homes to the sewer system, upgrading water treatment
        facilities, and constructing large rainwater storage reservoirs to prevent sewer overflow during heavy storms.
        </p>
        <p>
        While delays, triggered by the health impact of heavy rains, impacted some Olympic training sessions and the 
        men's triathlon event, competitions in the Seine eventually went ahead, bolstering confidence in the river's 
        safety for public swimming.
        </p>
        <p>
        Daily water quality tests will be conducted during the swimming season, with green and red flags - similar to 
        beach safety systems - indicating whether swimming areas are open or closed.
        </p>
        <p>
        "It's wonderful," said John Drummond, a 54-year-old visitor from Canada. "It's great for the environment, it's 
        great for the city, it's great for the people that live here. So very good initiative."
